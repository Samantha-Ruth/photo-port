## Description

This project's goal was to refactor a working application built with RESTful API into a working application based on a GraphQL API and Apollo Server.

When the user searches a book, the application will come up with a list of books based on that search from a Google API. When the user clicks on a book,  they should be able to see details about the book.

The user also has ability to log into the app.  When they do, they can save books they have searched and view the books they have saved in the application as well as delete books from their saved list.

The application helped me to learn how the MERN stack works with GraphQL.  It helped me learn how to build typeDef files, and resolvers composed of queries and mutations.  I practiced using the Apollo Studio Explorer to verify queries and mutations worked as expected, and transferred all previous api routes and controllers over to queries and mutations on the backside, as well as building the Apollo Server.  Once this was complete, I worked on refactoring the client side.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
