# Photo-Port

## Description

This project's goal was to create a professional photographer's portfolio using React, the create-react-app package, the react testing library, and run tests using the Jest-Dom. 

When the user visits the page, the application will render sample photography from the artist.  The user is presented with a navigation bar.

When they click on "About Me", the application will relocated to information about the artist on the page.

When they click on different genres of photos on the navigation bar, portfolio sections with each genre category will render.

The application helped me to develop my first app using React.  I learned how to develop components and to write in JSX to have components render in the App.js.
